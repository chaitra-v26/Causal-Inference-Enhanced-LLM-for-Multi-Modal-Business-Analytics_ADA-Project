# Causal Inference-Enhanced Large Language Models for Multi-Modal Business Analytics

## üìä Project Overview

This project combines cutting-edge causal inference techniques with advanced language models to revolutionize business analytics. By analyzing the impact of marketing campaigns on customer spending using robust causal effect estimation techniques, we seamlessly integrate these insights into a language model to generate dynamic, interpretable summaries and actionable recommendations for data-driven business strategies.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Design a cutting-edge framework combining causal inference and advanced language models to revolutionize business analytics. Analyze the impact of marketing campaigns on customer spending using robust causal effect estimation techniques. Seamlessly integrate these insights into a language model to generate dynamic, interpretable summaries and actionable recommendations, empowering businesses with data-driven strategies for optimized decision-making and measurable success.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Uniqueness

### 1. **Combination of Causal Inference and LLMs**
- Traditional ML models excel at prediction but fail to provide actionable insights about cause and effect
- This project estimates causal effects (e.g., how marketing campaigns change customer behavior)
- Uses BART language model to summarize effects in natural language format
- Makes complex results interpretable for non-technical stakeholders

### 2. **Cutting-Edge Techniques**
- Leverages state-of-the-art causal modeling techniques (propensity score matching, linear regression)
- Bridges the gap between statistical rigor and user-friendly communication
- Dynamic summarization using BART combines quantitative rigor with qualitative articulation

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source**: [Marketing Campaign Dataset - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodsaldanha/arketing-campaign)
- **Size**: 3,554 rows √ó 21 columns
- **Focus**: Marketing campaign impact on customer spending behavior
- Contains treatment, outcome, and confounder variables for comprehensive causal analysis

### Dataset Description
